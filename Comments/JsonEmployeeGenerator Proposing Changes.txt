1. The rows 13 and 14: These settings should go in a configuration file.
	string[] roles = new string[] { "Junior Developer", "Semi Senior Developer", "Senior Developer", "Principal", "Team Leader" };
	string[] teams = new string[] { "Platform", "Sales", "Billing", "Mirage" };

2. The rows from 24 to 26:
	e.Name = all_lines_in_file[i].Split('\t')[0];
	e.SurName = all_lines_in_file[i].Split('\t')[1];
	e.Email = all_lines_in_file[i].Split('\t')[2];
	
Should be rewritten to 
	jsRowData = all_lines_in_file[i].Split('\t');
	e.Name = jsRowData[0];
	e.SurName = jsRowData[1];
	e.Email = jsRowData[2];
	
and the declaration of the variable string[] jsRowData = null; should be outside of the foreach body. Also there should be a check for index out of range for the array.

3. For the rows from 54 to 67 I would use Json.NET library to generate the Json objects
4. I would put the class JsonEmployee in a separate file
5. There is no try catch block. The errors should be written somewhere
